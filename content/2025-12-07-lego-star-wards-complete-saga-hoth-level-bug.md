Today: Something off topic, to feed the search engines.

My kids and I have a lot of fun with the video game [Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Star_Wars%3A_The_Complete_Saga),
which was released in 2007. As it is quite old, the "complete saga" includes
only the episodes 1 through 6. Frankly, these are the only episodes that really
matter. I haven't really enjoyed the Disney Darth Duckface episodes that came
afterwards anyway.

The game is great because there's value in playing every level at
least twice.
You can't access all of the secret corners when playing in "story mode", and
there are a lot of fun easter eggs and jokes to discover: When you replay a
level with free character choice, you can unpot flowers and discover bathing
storm troopers.

However, I digress. The issue I want to write about was absurdly hard to
so I am doing my part in making the resolution easier to find on the internet.

Here's what happens: In the second level of Episode 5, "Escape from Echo Base",
you will encounter a room where you can build an orange motorcycle with a C3PO
logo on its back and batteries that will power two air vents.

The door to your next room can only be opened by C3PO, which you have freed just
before. The issue is that the door is one stair up and C3PO can NOT jump.
To get C3PO to the door, you must get the motorcycle to an air vent and let C3PO
swept up by the gust of air and onto the back of the motorcycle. That's the
easy part, the logo is pretty much telling you what to do.

<b>The issue that we had was that C3PO would not fall on the motorcycle. He would
always land subtly next to it, making it look like he clipped into it.</b>

We tried for about half an hour only to realize the following: This isn't "old
games being hard". Not a skill issue. This is truly a just a software bug.
Every once in a while when you start the level, C3PO just won't land. Whatever
you do.

<b>The solution is as old as software development: Quit the level and restart.</b>

Hope this will save you a few minutes, if you ever play this game.
