For those who don't know, I have provided countless
contributions to the Mozilla project. This is to an extent, that I
have been added to our credits page (type `about:credits` into Firefox!)
more than ten years ago. In February 2014, Mozilla constructed a real monument
as praise for the great people - over 4,500 names - who contributed
to the betterment of the web as part of Mozilla.

The monument was an
approximately 4 meters (14 foot) tall cuboid with a Firefox logo at the
top. The lower two thirds contained the names of people who
have contributed to the project. The vast list of names is also a nod to
the full-page Firefox advertisement that appeared in the New York Times ([pictures
here](https://blog.mozilla.org/press/2004/12/mozilla-foundation-places-two-page-advocacy-ad-in-the-new-york-times/))
and the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung ([pictures here,
featuring yours truly](/firefox-faz-ocr.html))
for the release of Firefox 1.0.

The text is split up with a big headline "Doing good is part of our code"
(punny!) and  the following description:

> These are the technologists, thinkers and builders, past and present,
> who help us keep the Internet alive and accessible â€” a global community
> dedicated to preserving the power and potential of the world's largest
> public resource.

However, with the move towards more decentralization and remote work,
Mozilla moved offices and needed to deconstruct the monument. It is now in
storage.

Surprisingly, I found relatively few pictures of this on the internet.
So, in order to preserve a bit of internet history (and as a huge brag, of course)
I am including two pictures of the monument with my name on it.
See if you can find me :-)
