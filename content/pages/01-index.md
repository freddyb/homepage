Hi,

my name is <strong class="noboldstrong">Frederik Braun</strong> and I'm a
security engineer and manager working on the Mozilla Firefox web browser. My
work on Firefox involves various topics ranging from security, web standards,
static analysis, bug bounty, and public speaking. Some of my major projects
include the
[eslint-plugin-no-unsanitized](https://github.com/mozilla/eslint-plugin-no-unsanitized/)
- which helps in [finding and fixing DOM-Based
XSS](https://frederik-braun.com/finding-and-fixing-dom-based-xss-with-static-analysis.html), the [Mozilla Attack & Defense blog](https://blog.mozilla.org/attack-and-defense/),
the paper [Hardening Firefox against Injection Attacks
(PDF)](/publications/hardening_paper.pdf) and the [Subresource
Integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity)
web standard.

I am particularly proud of the blog post [Examining JavaScript Inter-Process
Communication in
Firefox](https://blog.mozilla.org/attack-and-defense/2021/04/27/examining-javascript-inter-process-communication-in-firefox/),
which explains how to find a sandbox escape in Firefox.
The blog post was made into a video [What is a Browser Security Sandbox?! (Learn to Hack Firefox)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StQ_6juJlZY&t=0s), by YouTuber [LiveOverflow](https://www.youtube.com/@LiveOverflow).

<!-- I also co-authored a whitepaper about [the benefits of the X-Frame-Options
security header](xfo-clickjacking.pdf) with [Mario
Heiderich](http://heideri.ch/). It mostly shows attacks and techniques against
website that _can_ be framed and I now believe that a Content Security Policy
with `frame-ancestors: none` is just as good. -->

Before working at Mozilla, I wrote a [diploma thesis about the Same Origin
Policy](/publications/thesis/Thesis-Origin_Policy_Enforcement_in_Modern_Browsers.pdf) in 2012, which concluded my
studies of IT-Security at the [Ruhr University](https://www.rub.de/) in Bochum.
This is also where I co-founded the CTF team
[fluxfingers](https://fluxfingers.net).
