Here's a list of thigs that currently occupy my thoughts.

### Life

- looking forward to my daughter's first day of school
- riding my bike all summer long
- meeting my team IRL in Dublin
- polishing my web page

### Work

- [shipping way, way more HTTPS](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2024/06/05/firefox-will-upgrade-more-mixed-content-in-version-127/)
- [killing XSS](https://wicg.github.io/sanitizer-api/)
- preventing, finding, removing security bugs
- and generally squaring all the circles

### Reading

- *The Manager's Path* by Camille Fournier.

Inspired by [Derek Sivers' "now" page](https://sive.rs/now).
