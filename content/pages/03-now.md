*Last Updated: December 2025*

Here's a list of thigs that are currently happening. Or at least soon.

### Life

- I haven't told anyone, but I started running. 3 times a week for 4 weeks now.
- I want 2025 to be over. Lots of last-minute end-of-year things. Ugh.
- Looking forward to 39c3.

### Work

- We might actually be shipping my brainchild `setHTML()` and I am
crazy happy about that :D :D :D
- Hopefully being able to grow this amazing team of smart people a tiny bit more.
- Would really like to find time to hunt for a bug of my own, for a change :')

### Reading

- Hope to pick up reading again. It's truly my favorite way to unwind.
