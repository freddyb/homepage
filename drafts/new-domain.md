Title: How I got a new domain

Slug: new-domain

Welcome! If you're reading this, you might notice that my blog and this post is
on my new domain [frederikbraun.de](#).

And this is the story. The story of a young nerd in the 1990s. The story of
my aunt, who went to the Miniatur Wunderland, left the tourist attraction,
got past the secretary, and asked the owner if he still needs his domain.

# Many years ago

The story starts in my older brother's room. I was about 16 years old and it was
around the year 2000. Back then, I was not able to have my own internet access.
While I did have my own PC, only my brother and his PC were connected.
This was for one main reason: We had to run
a long ethernet cable from the phone connection to the PC and through the whole
flat. This ~20m cable was a solid tripping hazard
and also, more importantly, well protected by my older brother.

Anyway, while I was sitting in my brother's room hanging out on IRC and
learning about computer stuff. I also learned about how someone would get their
own domain and host web pages.
A very exciting topic back then. (To save my personal reputation, all of my
teenage home pages will remain unknown.)

The domain I wanted to
register at that time would have been frederikbraun.de, my real name as a cool
and nerdy place on the internet that I could use as an email or homepage.

Back in the day, other kid with an email address was at hotmail, yahoo or gmx.
It was clear to me that I could really show my extreme technical prowess by
having an own domain for basic internet stuff. (Remember, this was the 1990s
and I was a teenager. Of course I wanted to "show it to the whole world".)

Anyway, by the time I figured out how to register a domain name, I realized
that the most interesting variations of my name were taken. Not only where they
taken, they were used to redirect to a
[tiny model train museum in Hamburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniatur_Wunderland).

Aside: For those who don't know, the
[Miniatur Wunderland](https://www.miniatur-wunderland.com/) is now the
*largest* model railway system in the world and the one of the most popular
tourist attractions in Germany. (Though I have never actually visited).

Then I went to look at the DENIC (registry for `.de` names) website and tried
their [WHOIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS) client to learn more.
He's got the domain, he's using it to promote his business likely also for
email. I was stuck.

For years, I went on to continue checking the `WHOIS` entry regularly. Looking
for a potential expiration date. But then, at some point, I had to admit
defeat and get some other domains. (And as it goes with the stereotypical nerd,
many domains: frederik-braun.com, security.plumbing, 0e.vc, ...).

# Fast forward to the 2020s

At some point in the last year, I remembered this old story. I remembered that
it would still be nice to **get my domain**. So, I opened a new
Firefox tab and tried to open the page.

Huh. Nothing? The page didn't load. Oh, wow I thought. Am I lucky? Did the
domain expire? Turns out: No. The DNS entries are all wrong, but the domain
is still registered. At this point, I tried to learn more, but starting 2018,
the
registrar for `.de` [DENIC stopped supplying personal information in WHOIS to
comply with GDPR](https://www.denic.de/en/service/whois-service/). So, what
could I do? All I could learn was a broken DNS record and a WHOIS entry with the
"tech admin" contact for the domain. The admin contact pointed to a small IT
company in Hamburg, so my guess was that the domain was still owned by the same
Frederik as 20 years ago.

Then I tried probing the [`MX` records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MX_record)
and to my surprise, the domain wasn't even used for email addresses!
At this point, it became clear that the domain was perpetually renewed by its
owner, yet completely unused. I would just have to reach out..but how?

How do you *personally* reach the owner of Germany's most popular tourist
attraction?

I don't claim to have any
[OSINT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence) skills
but I tried searching around on the net. Lots of boulevard stuff mostly.
No page about the owners of the Wunderland on their homepage either.
Then I tried LinkedIN. No luck. They only show you people you're friends with
and then a hope or two. I tried a free LinkedIN Premium account. Still no luck.

I felt like I was stuck. Again.

# IRL

This all changed when our family visited my aunt earlier this spring.
My aunt tells me she is going to the Miniatur Wunderland with
colleagues from work next week.
I reminder her how funny it is, that the owner is also called Frederik Braun.
We wonder if she could ask around, see if she can get an email address of the
other Frederik.

And so she did: She walks right out of the tourist attraction and finds his
office. Naturally, the secretary tries to fend her off. The boss is busy, lots
of meetings. No can do.
Then, just when she tries to tell the whole story to the secretary again, the
owner walks by from the other direction. He wasn't even in his office.

So my amazing aunt tells the story again. The other Frederik finds the story
very amusing. It's apparently not the first time for him to find a namesake?
He asks if I am the opera singer by he same name (What?) and tells
her the email address I should use to reach out.

# The End

And that's what happens: I send a polite email, sharing my story and a couple
of weeks later here we are.

My blog is now on [frederikbraun.de](https://frederikbraun.de).
